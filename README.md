## How to run: 
1. Clone the repository, and navigate to flet_liftoff.
2. Run ``` pip install flet ```
3. Run ``` flet run mainchat.py ```

## Trouble-shooting
1. Package/object libmpv-dev not locatable
Likely due to older Ubuntu versions not being able to access it.
### Fix: 
```sudo add-apt-repository universe```
```sudo apt update```
```sudo apt install libmpv-dev```
Try step 3 again.
